    desc: Consolidate multi-arch artifacts and generate SHA256SUMS (for CI)
    silent: true
    summary: |
      Consolidate artifacts from multiple build jobs into release-artifacts/

      This is used by CI after downloading artifacts from parallel builds.
      Combines individual .sha256 files into a single SHA256SUMS file.

      Input: all-artifacts/ (from CI artifact downloads)
      Output: release-artifacts/ with consolidated SHA256SUMS
