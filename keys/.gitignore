# Keys Directory .gitignore
#
# This directory contains PGP signing keys for release artifacts.
# Only the PUBLIC key should be committed to the repository.
# Private keys and backups MUST NEVER be committed.

# === PRIVATE KEYS (NEVER COMMIT) ===
# These contain secret key material and must stay local
*-private.asc
*.sec
*.gpg

# === BACKUPS DIRECTORY (NEVER COMMIT) ===
# Contains timestamped backups of all generated keys (public and private)
# Generated by:
#   - task signing:generate-signing-key (creates backups/initial-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/)
#   - task signing:rotate (creates backups/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/)
# Kept locally for:
#   - Recovery from accidental deletion
#   - Verifying old releases with old keys
#   - Audit trail of key rotations
